## Project Overview
This is a public web for PasarMIKRO, mainly to market our offerings through the internet, targeting direct visit (for those who referred to us from various other channels), and optimizing SEO for a targeted researching customers (as our segment is very specific, we would like to champion this keyword in both from the buyer and source countries). For now we are targetting players originating from buyer countries especially Europe (operating worldwide, like coffee, cacao, natural fibers, palm oil, rubber, fishery, milk players), and Indonesian region.Buyer typically is looking for partners to solve their sustainability and compliance issues through services and (digital) platform. As well as the seller from Indonesia to comply to be able to sell to EU region. So the main language should be English.

## PasarMIKRO Overview

## Keywords Insight
In 2025, search behavior has matured. Users are moving away from broad "buzzwords" toward Technical Action Terms.
Key three buckets: Policy Drivers (the "Why"), Technical Enablers (the "How"), and Social Focus (the "Who"). 1. The "Must-Watch" Common Keyword List: Regulation, EUDR Compliance, CSDDD Value Chain, CBAM reporting, CSRD Scope 3, Traceability, Plot-level Traceability, Polygon Mapping, Geolocation Data, Digital Product Passport (DPP). The "Who": Smallholder Inclusion, Gender Equity in Supply Chain, Fair Business Models, Cooperative Governance, Interoperable, Data Silos, API Integration, Satellite Monitoring, Digital Due Diligence, Agriculture Regenerative ROI, Carbon Sequestration. Marine: e-PIT (Measured Catch), Blue Carbon Credits, GDST Standards, IUU Fishing Prevention 2. Identifying "Breakout" vs. "Steady" Themes: A. From "Sustainability" to "Legality", "Sustainability" is now seen as too vague. Search volume is moving toward "Legality" because the EUDR requires proof that products comply with the production country’s laws (e.g., land titles in Indonesia). Keywords: Legality verification, Land tenure, Social Forestry (Perhutanan Sosial). B. From "Manual" to "Interoperable" As Indonesia moves to systems like e-PIT for marine and STDB for agriculture. Interoperability keywords: Cross-platform data sharing, GDST interoperability, Unified Traceability. C. The "Smallholder Risk" Cluster, there is a massive search spike regarding the "exclusion" of small farmers. This is the biggest political and economic risk in the Indonesia-EU trade relationship right now. Keywords: Smallholder mapping gaps, Compliance cost-sharing, Inclusive traceability.
